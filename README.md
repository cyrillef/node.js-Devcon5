# [Node.js - Callback vs. Async Hell](http://www.html5report.com/conference/newyork/agenda.aspx?t=#CS-03)

Designing and crafting effective Node.js applications frequently involves a fundamentally different approach than we’ve seen in many platforms of the past. Rather than building monolithic functional structures, Node.js applications are composed of discrete components that complement each other and specialize. We’ll explore what works, and how Node.js applications are different. We’ll also review why asynchronous programming in Node.js is important and discuss nested callbacks and control flow implementation for readability and ease of reasoning.
